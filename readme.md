# Shoot - Federated Instant Messenger

Shoot is a (work in progress) instant messenger for the fediverse.

Connect with your friends on Shoot or other federated services like Mastodon, Pixelfed, \*key with
direct messages, group chats, and guilds.

Current features:

-   Direct messaging
-   Group chats
-   Guilds and channels
-   Voice chat
-	URL previews ('Embeds')
-	Message attachments
-	WIP Federation with other Shoot instances

Planned:

- [End to end encryption](https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/shoot/issues/55)
- [Federation with other fediverse software](https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/shoot/issues/67)
- [Mentions ('pings'), notifications](https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/shoot/issues/62)
- Video chat
- Lots of moderation and safety tooling

## Getting Started

Just want to chat? Check out these client applications:
- [Official Shoot Client](https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/shoot-client). You can find a hosted version of this web app [here](https://understars.dev/shoot-client)
- [Sheet](https://github.com/TheEntropyShard/Sheet)

Building a client? PRs to this list are welcome!

If you instead want to install the server or contribute, see below.

## Installation

Requires:
- Nodejs version 18 or higher
- Postgresql
- Git
- Optional: [Janus media server](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/) for voice chat support
- Optional: [Redis](https://redis.io/) can be used for the inbound federation queue.
- Optional: [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) can be used to horizontally scale Shoot.
- Optional: [Imagor](https://github.com/cshum/imagor) can be used as a remote image proxy for URL previews.
- Optional: [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [other API-compatible object storage](https://github.com/minio/minio) can be used to store user uploaded attachments and other media.

Once you have all the prerequisites set up, download and build the server:

```sh
# clone/download the latest server code
git clone https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/shoot.git
cd shoot

npm i # install dependencies

npm run build
```

You should now create a config file.
Shoot uses the [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) package for reading config files. By default, they will be read from the `config` directory, and supports [many file formats](https://github.com/node-config/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files#file-formats), although Shoot's CLI only supports JSON.

You can find all available config options along with their documentation [here](https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/shoot/blob/main/src/util/config.ts)

You can use `npm run cli -- generate-keys` to generate the public and private keys needed for federation. *You still need to enable federation by setting `federation.enabled` to `true`*
This command will also generate the JWT token used for user authentication.

Once you have your config file, you can start the server with:
```sh
npm run start
```

While you're in the server's CLI, you may also create a new user using the command:
```sh
npm run cli -- add-user [username]
```

Now you'll need a client. Head over to [shoot-client](https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/shoot-client) for the official Shoot client.

## Contributing

I've become pretty busy with my job, so I haven't had the time to work on Shoot.
I would love if anyone interested could contribute to the project.
Feel free to open any issues or pull requests, and I'll review them when I have the time.

### Tests

You can run the tests with `npm run test`.
Shoot uses [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for testing.
